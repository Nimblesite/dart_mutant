## Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` are
published on the [releases page](https://github.com/Nimblesite/dart_mutant/releases).
Linux and Intel macOS users should install [from source](#build-from-source).

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
VERSION=v0.1.0
curl -L "https://github.com/Nimblesite/dart_mutant/releases/download/${VERSION}/dart_mutant-${VERSION}-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz" | tar xz
sudo mv dart_mutant /usr/local/bin/
```

## Build from Source

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nimblesite/dart_mutant
cd dart_mutant
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
dart_mutant --version
# dart_mutant 0.1.0

dart_mutant --help
# Usage: dart_mutant [OPTIONS]
# ...
```

## Requirements

- **Dart SDK**: dart_mutant runs `dart test` internally, so you need Dart installed
- **Test suite**: Your project should have tests in `test/` directory
- **Git** (optional): Required for `--incremental` mode

## Next Steps

- [Quick Start](/docs/quickstart/) - Run your first mutation test
